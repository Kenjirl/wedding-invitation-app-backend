# Wedding Invitation App (Admin Panel)
This is a collaborative project with my friend. It is an app designed to manage the guest list for a digital wedding invitation.

I am responsible for the admin side, where the bride acts as the admin to manage the guest list.

Although it's a simple project, it has been a valuable experience working on a web app that meets real people's needs.

The app provides the following features:
- Stores a list of guests.
- Generates a unique invitation link for each guest.
- Sends the invitation via WhatsApp.
- Allows guests to confirm their attendance and send their wishes through the link.
- Enables the admin (the bride) to track the number of invitations sent and responses received.

## Admin Login Page
The account for admins are made using seeder beforehand.

## Admin Panel
This panel can only be accessed by the admin after logging in.

### Guest List
This is where the admin can manage guests. The admin can add and delete guests, send invitations, and mark those whose invitations have already been sent.

### RSVPs
Here, the admin can see how many guests have responded to the invitation, how many have accepted, how many have declined along with their reasons, and the total number of guests each invitee will bring.

### Comment/Wish from Guests
On this page, the admin can view the messages and wishes sent by the invited guests.

Those are all the features on the admin side that I've worked on. I'd say it's quite simple, but I enjoyed building it and exploring real-world cases that I could solve.
